PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

For project 4 I created a sneaker forum that allows users to browse through questions they may have and 
ask/ post questions about sneakers. This website has a login and register page, questions and answers page, 
and a dashboard page that containes the categories. When the user logs in they are directed to the dashboard. 
The user can also access the dashboard by clicking on "sneaker Forum" title in the navbar. 

PROJECT DETAILS

- In the register page, there is an area where the user can register themselves by inserting a username, email, and
  password. If the user tries to login with an email that already exists, a message will appear stating
  there may be an existing account with that email. If the user happens to put an email without the @ button
  they will get an error message. If the user creates a password that is less than 6 characters long, they
  will get an error message for that as well. Once the user successfully creates an account they will get
  a registration successful message and will be directed to the login page. 
  
- In the login page, there is an area where the user can put their email and password. Once the user is logged
  in, they will be directed to the dashboard. The user will still be able to view questions and answers even if
  they are not logged in. The user must log in if they want to post any questions or answers. 

- In the questions page, there is a list of common questions so the user can click on one of them and
  find the answer. This allows the users to find answers to their question faster. When the user clicks on the
  question they are directed to the answer page. There is a category tab next to the search bar at the top
  so the questions can be inserted into the correct category. The user is also able to delete their own question
  if they no longer need the answer.

- In the answers page, there is a text box where the user can put their own answer to a question asked
  by another user. Under the text box is a list of answers already posted by different users. The user is able
  to delete their own answer.

 - In the dashboard, there is a list of categories on the left side. The user is able to click on one
   of the categories and questions related to that category will appear on the right side. If the user clicks
   on one of the questions, they will be directed to the answer page. The user will be automatically directed
   to the dashboard upon logging in. The user can also access the dashboard by clicking the "sneaker forum" title
   in the navbar.

USER STORIES: 

- As a user, I want to be able to browse a list of questions to see if a question I have is already answered
  so I can quickly get the information I need without having to wait for an answer
 - As a user, I want to easily access answers to questions by clicking on the question and being directed to
   the answers instead of searching for the answers.
- As a sneaker expert, I want to be able to share my collections and discuss different trends with
  other users.
